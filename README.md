# ARC

ARC is an experimental web app that turns self improvement into a gamified experience.

You create an account, generate quests tied to personal attributes, complete them in real life, and gradually build a character that reflects your progress.

ARC already supports:
- Accounts with persistent progression
- Stat tracking and experience
- AI-generated quests based on selected attributes
- Quest completion that affects user stats

Although this project is still being expanded.

## Stack

- Node.js and Express
- PostgreSQL with Prisma
- OpenAI API
- Handlebars
- JS and CSS

## Config

The app uses environment variables for configuration (database connection, auth secrets, API keys). These are not included in the repository.
